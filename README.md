# Learning Rust 🦀

This repo contains my notes, exercises, and projects as I work through *The Rust Programming Language Book*.
It serves as a learning log and a collection of examples that demonstrate Rust concepts chapter by chapter.

## Structure
- Each folder corresponds to a chapter from the book with sub folders for each concept within the chapter.
- Code examples are written using `cargo` projects for easy compilation and experimentation.
- Notes and explanations are included where helpful to reinforce key ideas.

## Goals
- Build a strong foundation in Rust syntax and concepts.
- Practice writing safe, efficient, and idiomatic Rust code.
- Document my learning journey for future reference.

## Topics Covered
- Getting started with Cargo
- Variables and mutability
- Ownership and borrowing
- Structs, enums, and pattern matching
- Error handling
- Generics, traits, and lifetimes
- Concurrency and async programming
- Building real-world projects

## How to Use
Clone the repo and explore the chapter folders.  
To run any example:
```bash
cd chapter1_getting_started/hello_cargo
cargo run
